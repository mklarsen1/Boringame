This is the boring game. It was written to run in the terminal. It was created as the world's most tepid spoof of text adventure games. 

The only innovation I can offer is the text centering based on terminal size. That aside, it is truly boring.

Hopefully, future versions will offer ever-more-dull entertainment in order to repurpose screens into all-encompassing sleep machines.
